### About
***

This project extracts, transforms, and loads video game sales data from https://www.vgchartz.com. This dataset could be later used to analyze and answer the following questions:
-   Most popular video game console in various regions
-   Most popular video game across various consoles/regions/genre

### Extract
***
Wrote a [Jupyter notebook](Extract.ipynb) python script to scrape the video games data from www.vgchartz.com website using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to do the following:
-   Obtained the list of genres
-   Dynamically built the URL to scrape the pages of games data for each genre
-   Wrote the extracted raw video games data into [CSV file](Output/Extracted_video_games_data.csv) to be used for Transform process

### Transform
***
Wrote a [Jupyter notebook](Transform.ipynb) python script to do the following clean up and transformation steps to the raw video games data obtained from the Extraction process:
-   Deleted games without sales data
-   Removed unwanted columns and renamed the columns
-   Added Release year column
-   Converted Release date values to date format and Sales values to float format
-   Wrote the transformed video games data into [CSV file](Output/Transformed_video_games_data.csv) to be used for the Load process

Performed the following steps to Load the transformed video games data into PostgreSQL Database:
â€¢	Designed the database tables in normalized form and generated [ERD](Data_Modeling/ERD.png)
